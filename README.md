# rc505mkii_scripts
Useful scripts for rc505:

ConvertWavToFloat.ipynb
- first make a working copy of your 16 bit WAVE directory from your rc505mki on your drive
- run the script and choose that working copy of the rc505mki WAVE directory
- all of the WAV files in the subdirectories (e.g., 001_1-099_5) should now be 32 bit FLOAT WAV files
- swap this modified WAVE directory with the one in your rc505mkii when connected via usb
